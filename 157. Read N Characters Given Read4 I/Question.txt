Read N Characters Given Read4 I
The API: int read4(char *buf) reads 4 characters at a time from a file.

The return value is the actual number of characters read. For example, it returns 3 if there is only 3 characters left in the file.

By using the read4 API, implement the function int read(char *buf, int n) that reads n characters from the file.

Note: The read function may be called multiple times.

#The read4 API is already defined for you.
#@param buf, a list of characters
#@return an integer
def read4(buf):
	global file_content
	i = 0
	while i < len(file_content) and i < 4:
		buf[i] = file_content[i]
		i+= 1
	if len(file_content) > 4:
		file_content = file_content[4:]
	else:
		file_content = ''
	return i
