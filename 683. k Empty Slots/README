The idea is to use an array days[] to record each position's flower's blooming day. That means days[i] is the blooming day of the flower in position i+1. We just need to find a subarray days[left, left+1,..., left+k-1, right] which satisfies: for any i = left+1,..., left+k-1, we can have days[left] < days[i] && days[right] < days[i]. Then, the result is max(days[left], days[right]).
